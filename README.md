# Scrapy Experiments

A simple scrapy project to get up to speed on the library. Contains
three scapers that grab the prices of music CDs from the newly launched
Amazon.com.au, Sanity.com.au, and AtlantisMusic.com.au. There is also a
script that consumes the scraper outputs and finds the items with the
biggest price differences.


## Features

* Amazon.com.au scraper
* Sanity.com.au scraper
* AtlantisMusic.com.au scraper


## Requirements

* Python 3.6 (3.3+ should work, but untested)


## How to

    $ scrapy list
